# Neural-Network-in-Java
This Consist of basic Neural Network Configuration in Java for Understanding its Working 

It Has Backpropagation Algorithm Iplemented and Complete Working is present here. Although it Is Present in 
DeepLearning4j but it is for understanding purpose only. 

Requirements: -
 It requires a bunch of files for input and output in specific style 
 Explanation is Coming Soon.....
